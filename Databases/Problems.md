# Problems

- [x]  The queries for getting a table for a day are separated by hour. So that means there's 5 queries only for one day. This is very inefficient and time consuming.

- [x] A fix for this could be to get the current day and then query for all the hours in the next 7 days.

# TODO

- [x] Add another table with the specifics of a reservation (i.e Options, message, etc.)
- [x] Implement the 'My Reservation' page, where an user can view its past/future reservations and cancel future reservations.
- [x] Make the use case diagram
- [x] Make the `options` rows delete automatically when the corresponding `reserved_dates` is deleted
- [ ] Update the main.php classes diagram
